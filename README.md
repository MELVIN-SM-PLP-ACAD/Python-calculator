#  Python Calculator Program

A simple **command-line calculator** built in Python.  
It allows you to enter mathematical expressions in one line (e.g., `10+5`, `20-3`, `4*6`, `12/4`) and keeps a **history of calculations** saved in a file.

---

##  Features
- Perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Enter full expressions in one line (`10+5`)
- Saves results with **timestamps** to `results.txt`
- Shows the **last 5 results** when you start the program
- Type **`history`** to view all saved calculations
- Type **`exit`** to quit the program

##  Project Files
- `calculator.py` → Main Python program  
- `results.txt` → Stores history of calculations (auto-created)
